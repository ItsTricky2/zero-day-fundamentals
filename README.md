# zero-day-fundamentals
This repository is a collection of projects to build the necessary skills in the evolving world of networking and software engineering with the rise of AI and other technological advances.
It is a comprehensive 16-week plan is divided into four phases, each focusing on hands-on projects in networking, operating systems, infrastructure, and cyber operations. The projects use your MacBook Pro (with Parallels for VMs) and emphasize terminal-based workflows. Whenever possible, we’ll tie the lessons back to your Cosmos validator environment. Each week’s project includes a title, summary, tools/concepts, step-by-step instructions, theory explanations, example commands, documentation guidance, and optional extensions. The goal is to spend about 6–12 hours per week on each project (adjustable by depth) and document everything in a GitHub repository (including code, scripts, markdown notes, and screenshots).
